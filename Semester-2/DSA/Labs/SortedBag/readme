14. ADT Sorted Bag – using  a  hashtable  with  coalesced  chaining  in  which  (unique  element, frequency)  pairs
    are  stored. In  the  constructor  of  the  iterator  create  an  array  of  (element, frequency) pairs,
    sorted by the element and use that array for iterating.


    Node:
    key: TKey
    next: Node

    HashTable:
    T: ( Node) []
    m: Integer
    h: TFunction
