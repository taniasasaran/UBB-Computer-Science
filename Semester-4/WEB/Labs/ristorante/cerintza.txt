In this lab you will have to develop a server-side web application in PHP. 
The web application has to manipulate a Mysql database with 1 to 3 tables 
and should implement the following base operations on these tables: 
select, insert, delete, update. 
Also the web application must use AJAX for getting data asynchronously 
from the web server and the web application should contain at least 
5 web pages (client-side html or server-side php).

For the database, you can use the mysql database on www.scs.ubbcluj.ro. 
On this myql server you have an account, a password and a database, 
all identical to your username and password on the SCS network.

Please make sure that you avoid sql-injection attacks when working with the database.

Have in mind the user experience when you implement the problem:
- add different validation logic for input fields
- do not force the user to input an ID for an item if he wants to 
 delete/edit/insert it; this should happen automatically 
 (e.g. the user clicks an item from a list, and a page/modal 
 prepopulated with the data for that particular item is opened, 
 where the user can edit it)
- add confirmation when the user deletes/cancels an item
- do a bare minimum CSS that at least aligns the various input fields

Problems
Write a web application for managing food recipes. 
The application should maintain various information about a recipe 
in the database (i.e. author, name, type, the actual recipe etc.). 
The application should implement: recipes browsing (use AJAX for retrieving 
recipes of a specific type), adding, removing and updating a recipe. 
Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action 
(i.e. recipe type), should be displayed (do this in javascript).
