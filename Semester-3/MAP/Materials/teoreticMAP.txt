####Overwrite vs Override vs Overload####
To "overwrite" something is to put something else in
its place, destroying the thing overwritten. To "override"
something is to cause something else to operate instead of
it without harming or changing the thing overridden.
Overload means multiple methods of the same name in
the same class, and all methods work in different ways.

####Static vs Non static####
Static variables or fields belong to the class, and
not to any object of the class. A static variable is
initialized when the class is loaded at runtime. 

####Interface vs Abstract class####
An abstract class allows you to create functionality
that subclasses can implement or override. An interface
only allows you to define functionality, not implement it.

####Reference vs Primitive####
A primitive variable's information is stored
 as the value of that variable, whereas a reference 
variable holds a reference to information related to
that variable. Primitive types are boolean, byte, char,
short, int, long, float and double. All other types
are reference types, so classes.

####Generics####
Generics means parameterized types.
Generic methods and classes can be built for a more general use. 

####Generic Arrays####
Arrays store and check type information at runtime.
Generics, however, check for type errors at compile-time
and don't have type information at runtime.

####Wildcards####
In generic code, the question mark (?), called the wildcard,
represents an unknown type. The wildcard can be used in a
variety of situations: as the type of a parameter, field,
or local variable; sometimes as a return type (though it
is better programming practice to be more specific).

####Buffers####
What are buffers in Java?
A buffer is a linear, finite sequence of elements of a specific
primitive type. Aside from its content, the essential properties 
of a buffer are its capacity, limit, and position.

####Multithreading####
Multithreading is the ability of a program or an operating system 
to enable more than one user at a time without requiring multiple 
copies of the program.

####Possible states of a thread####
NEW. A thread that has not yet started is in this state.
RUNNABLE. A thread executing in the Java virtual machine is in this
state.
BLOCKED. A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock is in 
this state.
WAITING. ...
TIMED_WAITING. ...
TERMINATED.

####Thread sync####
Synchronization in Java is the capability to control the access 
of multiple threads to any shared resource.
