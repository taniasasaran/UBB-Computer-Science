L1a

6.a)Write a function to test whether a list is linear.
b)Write a function to replace the first occurence of 
an element E in a given list with an other element O.
c)Write a function to replace each sublist of a list 
with its last element. A sublist is an element from the 
first level, which is a list. Example: 
(a (b c) (d (e (f)))) ==> (a c (e (f))) 
==> (a c (f)) ==> (a c f)
(a (b c) (d ((e) f))) ==> (a c ((e) f)) 
==> (a c f)
d)Write a function to merge two sorted lists without keeping double values.


L1b

12. Determine the list of nodes accesed in preorder in a tree of type (2).
A binary tree is memorised in the following two ways:(node no-subtrees list-subtree-1 list-subtree-2 ...)(1)(node (list-subtree-1) (list-subtree-2) ...)(2)As an example, the tree
 A
/ \
B  C
  / \
 D   E  is represented as follows:(A 2 B 0 C 2 D 0 E 0)(1)  (A (B) (C (D) (E)))(2)
